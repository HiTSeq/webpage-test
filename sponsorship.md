  HiTSeq is one of the best attended track meetings of
  ISMB-ECCB. HiTSeq spans two days and provides a forum to discuss new
  methods, tools, and algorithms for the analysis of high-throughput
  sequence data. We accept original contributions that are
  peer-reviewed and published as part of the ISMB proceedings, as well
  as abstracts for talks and posters. We have held this meeting for
  over 15 years with last attendance numbers surpassing 500
  researchers and bioinformaticians.

  <p>Contributions for sponsorship start at the $5,000 level, where we
    provide acknowledgement at our website, during the conference, and
    at the event, and we also provide a poster board, and if suitable
    distribute literature at the conference room. Sponsorships are
    typically used to pay for keynote speakers travel, travel
    fellowships for young scientists, and support social events.
    Contributions could be specifically associated with any of these,
    e.g., sponsoring travel for a specific keynote speaker related to
    the topic of sponsor's market. We also potentially provide a
    greater presence at the conference, including the possibility of
    having a talk during a sponsored dinner.<br />
     <br />
    Contributions are made directly to the International Society for
    Computational Biology through an invoice issued for the value of
    the sponsorship, they are earmarked to our meeting, and are tax
    deductible.</p>
