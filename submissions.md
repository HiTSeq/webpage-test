  <h2>Call for Proceedings</h2>
  We are soliciting high-quality papers that will go through rigorous
  peer-review. Accepted papers will be presented at HiTSeq as either
  posters or talks, and will be published in a special proceedings
  section of the Bioinformatics journal. Papers requiring extensive
  revisions will be considered separately as regular papers for the
  Bioinformatics or Bioinformatics Advances journals and as abstracts
  for HiTSeq. All manuscripts should be submitted via the <a href="https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2025">ISMB/ECCB
    2025</a> Proceedings submission system. During submission please
  select the general subject of your submissions, and then make sure
  to <strong>specify</strong> <strong>HiTSeq</strong> as the COSI of
  your submission, to ensure your manuscript is assigned to our track.
  Please follow the submissions guidelines and process as for the rest
  of the ISMB Proceedings Submissions.

  <h2>Call for Abstracts</h2>
  <p> We are soliciting high-quality <b>unpublished</b> abstracts.
    Accepted abstracts will be presented at HiTSeq as either posters
    or talks. All abstracts should be submitted via the
    <!-- TODO
    <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ismbe024abstract">-->
    ISMB/ECCB 2025 Abstracts submission system<!-- </a>-->. <b>Please make sure to
      select HiTSeq as track </b>to ensure your manuscript is
    assigned to our track. Please submit your abstracts as 1-2 page
    PDF files, with font size 11, and <i>reasonable</i> margins. </p>
  <p> You can submit either: 
    <br />
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Unpublished work: Short talk and/or poster abstracts. 1-2
      page PDF, with font size 11, and <i>reasonable</i> margins.</li>
    <li> Published work for the Highlights Track: Full published paper
      with a cover letter stating why your work should be highlighted
      at HiTSeq. </li>
  </ul>
  <p> HiTSeq late abstracts will be evaluated for selection as posters
    only. The abstracts should target topics of immediate relevance in
    the field. To be considered for an oral presentation the material
    should not have been previously published in any journal or
    proceedings. </p>
  <p>Abstracts should be divided in "Background", "Results", and
  "Conclusions" sections, and can extend to up to 2 pages in order to
  permit proper review and assignment to poster or talks. Unless the
  authors specify that the submission is for poster presentation only,
  all abstracts will be considered for oral presentations as well. The
  final decisions whether each paper or abstract is presented as a
  talk or a poster will be made and communicated to authors as per the
  conference schedule. Authors of abstracts selected for oral
  presentations should confirm their intent to attend the conference
  and present their work promptly, else their slot will be allocated
  to other abstract. All proceedings paper submissions will be
  automatically considered for abstracts irrespective of the outcome
  of the full paper review.</p>
